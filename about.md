This project sets a minimal model to an open science clinical trial. It encompasses experimental design, patient number calculation, ethical desidentification of records, image management and sharing, statistical analysis, results presentation in web form, manuscript draft, and many more. comunjity is free to join and contribute to this project. It lies in a GitHub repository so it is freely hackable and open source. The aim of the project is to set a standard to an open science notebook for a small clinical trial, one that can be sponsored in a single institution with limited resources. However, through N of 1 strategies, it may potentially scalable to larger studies.

Initially, this project launched a small model trial - VALKYRIE, that was really designed, submitted to an IRB and prepared to accrue real patients. The trial was activated in june 2016 and never started the patient accrual. The small team that gathered to begin the study, specially me and professor Juvenia B. Fontenele, struggled with financial, personal and structural problems in our institutions, our country, and our lives. Finally, it became apparent that it would be unwise to continue pursuing this study now and we chose to close it definitely. This has not stopped us from devoting ourselves to the idea of open science and open clinical research. That's why the VALKYRIE trial turned into an open clinical research model. 

**VALKYRIE** is the acronym of **Val** proic acid, **(K)Chemo** therap **y** and **R** adiation therapy for patients with diffuse **i** ntrinsic pontin **e** glioma.

It is a small proof-of-concept trial, whose primary goal is to determine if valproic acid added to a contemporary radiochemotherapy protocol could result in better survival and quality of life for the patients.

Here we summarize the basic elements of this trial:

> **P** opulation of interest: children and adolescents with *diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma - DIPG*.

> **I** ntervention: valproic acid added to radiochemotherapy.

> **C** omparative group: historical control (no in-trial comparative group).

> **O** utcome: global survival and quality of life.

This study was designed by Francisco Helder Cavalcante Felix, pediatric hemato-oncologist at the Pediatric Cancer Center of Albert Sabin Children's Hospital. It will be completely developed in this institution, a public government hospital in Cear√° State, Brazil.

Complete documentation for this project can be found in a public repository [here](http://github.com/fhcflx/valkyrie/).

Trial was activated in 06/01/2016. The project has been currently put on a hold until January 2017.

This site is the open science notebook for the project.

To design this static site, I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted it at [Github Pages ](https://pages.github.com/) . Inspiration came from [Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info/index.html) and his [**open lab notebook**](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html). The general idea was to create a clinical trial data self-publish model compliant with [open notebook science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science), a true [open science clinical trial](https://github.com/fhcflx/valkyrie) that will foster the clinical research implementation of [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).
