**VALKYRIE** is the acronym of **Val** proic acid, **(K)Chemo** therap **y** and **R** adiation therapy for patients with diffuse **i** ntrinsic pontin **e** glioma.

It is a small proof-of-concept trial, whose primary goal is to determine if valproic acid added to a contemporary radiochemotherapy protocol could result in better survival and quality of life for the patients.

Here we summarize the basic elements of this trial:

> **P** opulation of interest: children and adolescents with *diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma - DIPG*.

> **I** ntervention: valproic acid added to radiochemotherapy.

> **C** omparative group: historical control (no in-trial comparative group).

> **O** utcome: global survival and quality of life.

This study was designed by Francisco Helder Cavalcante Felix, pediatric hemato-oncologist at the Pediatric Cancer Center of Albert Sabin Children's Hospital. It will be completely developed in this institution, a public government hospital in Cear√° State, Brazil.

Complete documentation for this project can be found in a public repository [here](http://github.com/fhcflx/valkyrie/).

Trial was activated in 06/01/2016. The project has been currently put on a hold until January 2017.

This site is the open science notebook for the project.

To design this static site, I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted it at [Github Pages ](https://pages.github.com/) . Inspiration came from [Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info/index.html) and his [**open lab notebook**](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html). The general idea was to create a clinical trial data self-publish model compliant with [open notebook science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science), a true [open science clinical trial](https://github.com/fhcflx/valkyrie) that will foster the clinical research implementation of [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).
