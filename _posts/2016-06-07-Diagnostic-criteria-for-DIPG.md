#### Criteria for diagnosis of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas:

Although there are no diagnostic criteria defined in the literature, we use a definition similar to that found in the [HIT-GBM-D][hit] trial protocol:

> Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma:
  center: pons, T1 tumor: hypointense, T2: hyperintense, CT: mostly
  hypodense, When Compared to regular pontine tissue. Diffuse tumor with margins
  and extension to more than half of the brainstem cross diameter. The regular
  pontine tissue might either Been missing in the level of the maximal tumor
  extension or might Have Been reduced to a small kidney, but is not simply
  dislocated by a single solid tumor nodule (...). This group has a tumor
  clinical history of less than 6 month. The diagnoses can be made
  radiologically without histological verification.

Tumor __centered in pons__, hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2, hypodense on CT, __diffuse__ (no well delimited borders), extension to __more than half of the pons (brainstem) cross diameter__. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study depicted below illustrates a case of a patient admitted to our hospital service diagnosed with DIPG. Note the T1 and T2-weighted sequences: one can observe an infiltrating lesion "inflating" the entire cross length of the pons, with iso-hypointensity in T1, little or no contrast enhancement and signal hiperintensity in T2/FLAIR, without clear demarcation of borders.

A study published by [Hankinson _et al_][hankinson] investigated the reproducibility of DIPG diagnostic accuracy by magnetic resonance images evaluated by experienced neurosurgeons. The authors concluded that there was inconsistency in the diagnosis and management of the cases evaluated. A representative picture of the different patterns of DIPG found was published:

 The diagnostic criteria suggested in this work are:
 > 1. an intrinsic, central location involving more than 50% of the axial diameter of the pons;
   2. indistinct tumor margins;
   3. T1 hypointensity;
   4. T2 hyperintensity;
   5. irregular, if any, enhancement following gadolinium administration; and
   6. the absence of cystic or exophytic components.
 Encasement of the basilar artery is another frequent, less consistently described characteristic.
