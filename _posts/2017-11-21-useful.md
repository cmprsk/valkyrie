description: I shamelessly borrow the definition of useful clinical research from John P. Ioannidis
---

Clinical research should be useful, says John P. Ioannidis, a greek statistician that devoted his carrer to point out that most clinical research are really not so useful. This is the minimum that anyone should expect from clinical research. And what are the features that we can use to judge if a particular research and its results may really contribute to science and society? Dr. Ioannidis gives us eight proposed characteristics of useful clinical research in a recent opinion statement [1].

1. **It must be problem-based:** one must summarize it in a very clear, objective question, clinically meaningful. _Could HDAC inhibitors be used to treat diffuse midline gliomas_ is an example, albeit a weak one (I shall elaborate further on this). 
2. **The problem must be placed into context:** prior knowledge has to be assessed in order to map possible holes in the evidence framework and contextualize the problem. For instance, _review of published evidence tells us that thre is no known pharmacological treatment for diffuse midline glioma_ (again a weak example).
3. **The study must be powerful enough** or, in other words, recruit so many patients and be sufficiently long as to have a practical chance of answering the proposed question. The design of a study may use statistical calculations to find its optimal recruit number and time length. A possible example: _using the available data of the patients already treated in our service as a pilot group, assuming an odds ratio of 0.05 and choosing a statistical power of 80% and alpha of 0.5%, the minimum number of patients in the experimental group (in a 1:2 design) will be 16 patients_.
4. **Aplicabilicade:** o estudo, tal como desenhado, reflete a prática no dia-a-dia? Se existem diferenças, estas importam para o desfecho final? Exemplo:
