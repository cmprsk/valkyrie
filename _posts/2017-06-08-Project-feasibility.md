## Evaluation of the current feasibility of the project

In August 2016, 10 months ago, we took the initiative to request an amendment to the Valkyrie Project due to uncertainties about our ability to carry out the project. Such uncertainties stem from the fact that the trial is based on the treatment of patients in an institution of the Public Health System (SUS), the political instability and the economic and institutional crisis that the country is experiencing. At the time, we requested the postponement of the beginning of the clinical trial for January of this year (2017), in order to await a better definition of the general framework. During this period, a number of new events occurred:


1. Generalized institutional crisis, with lack of representation of the current government of our country.
2. Accentuation of the economic crisis, despite the previously optimistic news.
3. The largest cut ever made in the science and technology budget was made this year in our country.
4. Generalized uncertainty about the ability to reverse this picture.
5. Unprecedented political crisis, with several members of the current government and their allies accused of serious crimes, with possible economic repercussions.
6. Lack of guarantees of supply of drugs of immediate need in our hospital unit. With emphasis on a chronic shortage of chemotherapeutics used in our service, which has occurred this year.
7. Lack of guarantees of specialized services, such as laboratory exams and procedures of high complexity, in our unit.
8. Cuts of personnel and absence of guarantee of minimum maintenance of the services offered to the population.

In view of this gloomy picture, we decided, myself and the main members of the group responsible for carrying out the Valkyrie Project, to reassess the viability of the Project as a whole, to decide for its continuity or not.

The project, in its methodology, provides:

> Image evaluation: contrasted nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed at the study entrance (diagnosis), and every 2 months after diagnosis. The images will be stored in electronic format (DICOM).

> Laboratory evaluation: laboratory tests (blood count, blood glucose, electrolytes, renal function, hepatic function, coagulogram) will be performed at the patient's admission to the study and repeated as required for the chemotherapy protocol or at medical discretion.

> (...)

> 5.5. Intervention:

> Oral drug: valproic acid (...)
> Simultaneous radiochemotherapy.

> (...)

> Cisplatin (CDDP), infusion over 1 hour, 20 mg / m2 / day, on days D1-5.

> Etoposide (VP16), infusion over 2 h or more, 100 mg / m2 / day on D1-3 days.

> Vincristine (VCR), IV injection, 1.5 mg / m2 (maximum 2 mg), day D5.

> (...)

> Ifosfamide (IFO), infusion over 1 hour, 1.5 g / m2 / day, days D1-5.

> (...)

> Support care

Among these interventions listed, unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the capacity to perform 100% of anyone. The reasons are as follows:

- Delay in performing imaging tests and inability to schedule this scarce resource on the frequency needed for the test (every 2 months).
- Delays in the results of some laboratory tests, such as serum chemotherapy and valproic acid levels.
- Recurrent supply shortage of chemotherapeutic drugs for routine use.
- Inability of the hospital service to guarantee adequate support care, due to the chronic overcrowding of the emergency sector.

We must admit that there is a lack of minimum guarantees that the proposed trial can be carried out respecting its prerogatives and planned treatment, in addition to respect and ethics for the subjects of study. In this setting, it is difficult to propose the continuity of the project, even if a new postponement should be requested. Given this, I and the group responsible for the project unanimously decided to close the Valkirye Project and withdraw it from the Plataforma Brasil and REBEC records. We are immediately taking steps to implement this decision, with prompt communication to the IRB.
