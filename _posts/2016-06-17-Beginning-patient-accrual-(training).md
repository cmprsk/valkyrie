```This post shows a probable depiction of what we expect to be the enrollment of the first patient in VALKYRIE. This is a simulation, once the study still needs additional preparation and internal considerations. We show a possible problem that could happen during image review and its implications. We also discuss the best momment of letting information to be public.

## First patient with DIPG to be enrolled:

Today we are confirming the enrollment of the first DIPG patient to be treated according to the VALKYRIE protocol. Notice about this patient came to us from Dr. Sandra. After initial clinical evaluation and image review, I concluded for the enrollment of this patient, after informed consent. This week, I explained the treatment plan to the patient's familly, and today got the signed consent.

### Considerations in image evaluation

In this particular case, we have found the first problem with the study's methodological design. MRI were provided as printed films, and there was no access to digital images in standard dicom format. After a brief discussion with Dr. Sandra, we decided to stand by our evaluation and for the enrollment of this patient in spite of missing digital image files. In such cases, I will review images the traditional way, by examining printed films. Whenever possible, the images will be photographed to be archived. Image review, in the present case, showed the fulfillment of requirements to enrollment in VALKYRIE trial.

### Protection to patient's confidentiality

As a guarantee of our commitment to protect personal informations of patients, we decided not to make public the individual patient's data at the time of enrollment. Instead of it, we are only remarking the inclusion of new data. This choice was made in order to prevent re-identification by a third party based on approximate enrollment date. Therefore, I will publish individual patient data in lots, and in random order, beginning at the end of accrual period. Active de-identification is an important priority in our project. Although we advocate information transparency, and public disclosement of analyses and conclusions, we also want to protect confidentiality of patients and their families.
