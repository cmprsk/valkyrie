On August 17 this year, I fell ill with what was later discovered to be the Chikungunya fever. From that moment began my challenge history. The acute phase of the disease lasted about 10 days, with what is classically reported: high fever, joint pain, a lot of trouble walking, rash, and what else you can expect from Chikungunya. I had heard from some people with the disease who were making use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. I initially criticized this type of treatment. The truth, some time later, was that I would gladly be starting these treatments. I did not believe at first that the disease could be as chronic as it was said or expected.

The disease made me change my mind. It put me in a state where I can not write, type or even read for a long time. This text for example, I am writing through voice dictation. It would be very difficult for me to write a long text with my hands at that time. Also I can not walk much. My steps are unsecured, small, unsteadily. I am now going through the second stage of the disease, the second flare since starting the chronic phase. This is not very encouraging. This is a harbinger of a long confrontation period ahead. I'm not too afraid, or at least do not want to be. However I am thinking about the things I had planned to do and that probably will not be able to continue. That's why I started writing this post.

I started this open clinical research notebook thinking about the future. Imagining I could be able to contribute for society to accept more easily the free exchange of clinical information from controlled trials. Especially when talking about the business or the scientific community. Clinical research is trapped in a very limited information sharing model. Boldly, I submitted a trial project to the IRB of my institution. Made this without even knowing yet if I would be able to take it forward. The conditions, I imagined, would be built throughout the process. It seems that the process was stopped early. This brings me some sadness, but I can still use what I have done to encourage others to continue this type of project. And that's what I intend to do. I will turn the Valkyrie project in a open clinical trial notebook format model. I can not overtake the project forward as I would like. However, I count on the interest that may arise elsewhere, by others, also questioning the current model of clinical research and also bold.

Will you who are reading these lines be one of those people? Why not? Just start. Just as I started. If you can not finish it, do like me and pass the baton on. The race will always continue, so long as there are people to run. The ultimate prize is worth it: a world where information obtained from the detachment of volunteers who participate in clinical research will be freely disseminated to all, regardless of any other factor. This project does not need to go against capitalism, or profit, or against the individuality of people. Just need to go against authoritarianism, totalitarianism, built-in safeguard information by third parties, just to control how this information is exploited. It is, in fact, to democratize information. Completely. Today, the control of this information belongs to a small group of people virtually unknown. Individuals who generate information, both voluntary patients and researchers rarely have the ultimate control over this data.

Initiatives that already exist around the world are important, but they are fragmented and are not addressing the full context of the situation. This will lessen their impact. Among these initiatives is Ben Goldacre's AllTrials.net. Simply to register any and all clinical trial will not be enough for that information to be more transparent, but it's a start. It is up to us all to continue, so that the future is brighter. Who knows, one day, an open notebook research will help find a really effective treatment for chikungunya, and help people like me.
