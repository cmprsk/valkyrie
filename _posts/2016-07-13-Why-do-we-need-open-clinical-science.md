### More transparency in clinical research

The reasons why clinical research is done should be obvious. However, one must address them and try to summarize them into a few working principles if an in depth analysis is to be carried out. It is probably a consensus that clinical research aims to develop new treatments for ailments. That said, it should be a corollary that clinical research seeks the benefit of the public. Additionally, it is paramount to clinical research the protection of the experimental subject.
In other words, the individuals that participate in clinical research must not be submitted to unethical or inhumane conditions or procedures, and this includes their privacy. A third principle could be stated as follows: clinical research must adhere to a rigid methodology in order to ensure the highest possible likelihood of reliability of the results. This will guarantee that the resources spent in the research are not wasted in futile efforts.

This leads us to a set of three principles one could summarize as goes:

1. Uphold the interest of the public.
2. Protect the integrity of the participant.
3. Follow a strict method.

What is the best way to ascertain that all clinical research will adopt these principles to the heart? The answer is very difficult, and no one has ever succeeded completely in this intent, as far as I know. A series of reasons complicates the prospect of clinical research, but the most important seem to be conflicts of interest from funders and scientists. However, one may not underestimate the influence of widespread cultural beliefs of science makers and the general public and a pervasive unfamiliarity of the meaning and shortcomings of statistical methods. These are not really small problems. The net result of the clinical research difficulties are low probability of publication of final results of clinical trials (even when they are clinically meaningful), and overall lack of transparency of information derived from clinical trials.

How to revert this situation? There are many initiatives and propositions that try to address this problem. Briefly, one can divide them in two wide sets or groups: weak (conservative) reform models or strong (non-conservative) reform models. Both aim the same thing: optimize the information productive chain in clinical research. Information can be viewed as an asset, the most important one in this kind of model. The problem can be stated as one of inefficient utilization of this asset. Conservative models generally do not propose major changes in the way information is generated and monetized, but try to effect a discipline upon the agents of this production chain. One can have property of information, but will have to conform to a series of good practices. These practices include mostly registering the clinical research (trial) and its results. Non-conservative models, on the contrary, defy the paradigm of information generation, monetization and ownership. They are based on the idea that information is a property of all people. These models argue against ownership of information by individuals or collectives, and advocate the widespread use of open publication of information in the world wide web.
