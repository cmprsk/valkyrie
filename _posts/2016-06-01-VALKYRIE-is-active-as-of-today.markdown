VALKYRIE (VALQUIRIA in portuguese) is a clinical trial studying the treatment of children and adolescents with diffuse tumors of the pons (brainstem), a serious disease difficult to treat, and currently with no established curative therapy. This study evaluates the possibility of improving treatment outcomes (quality of life and survival of patients) with the use of valproic acid, an antiepileptic drug already used for decades in children and adolescents. Recently, new discoveries have shown that most patients with diffuse pontine tumors have a genetic mutation which causes a change in the way the genes are rendered 'readable' by the cell machinery. This alteration can be reverted by valproic acid, and thus tumor cells may become less resistant to treatment.

VALKYRIE was approved by the Institutional Board of the Albert Sabin Children's Hospital ([Hospital Infantil Albert Sabin][hias]) and registered in [Plataforma Brasil][platbrasil], a brazilian national registry of institutional boards and the Brazilian Network for Clinical Trials ([Rebec][rebec], brazilian national registry of clinical trials. The [trial][ rebec-valq] is active from today and this is the website where all the information about its progress will be posted. Throughout the project, partial results may be checked on this page, making this a clinical trial based on [* open science * ][ciaberta], a public and transparent way of scientific research. More about open science and on the proposal of work, copies of the project in various formats and other information can be accessed on the official repository of the project [here]().

Today, we had a pitch meeting in the chemotherapy day unit (known as "First Floor") in Pediatric Cancer Center at Albert Sabin Children's Hospital. Here we are treating the patients of the trial, when the patient accrual begins. The meeting included Dr. Nadia Trompieri, Dr. Orlandira Ara√∫jo and miself (Dr. Felix). They confirmed their roles in the evaluation and treatment of patients, we reviewed the main model of patient entry in the trial and decided officially for activating the project. The entry of the patients will be first decided at the Neurosurgery ward ("F unit" of the Albert Sabin Children's Hospital), and will be in charge of Dr. Sandra Albuquerque. After the initial assessment of candidate patients for entry in the trial, Dr. Sandra is sending the magnetic resonance imaging to central review, anonymously (deidentified). As I am in charge of reviewing images, I will evaluate and confirm the diagnosis of DIPG. Then I am giving permission to start patient accrual process. The team of graduate students of Professor Juvenia Fontenele will consent forms signed by the patient's family. If consent is provided, the patient will be referred to Drs Nadia and Orlandira to start the protocol treatment.

In summary, the steps from the entry of the patients are going to be:

* Identification of the applicant
* Anonymous central review of images
* Informed consent
* Referral to treatment

The study is looking forward to ANVISA for the documentation to start patient accrual.
