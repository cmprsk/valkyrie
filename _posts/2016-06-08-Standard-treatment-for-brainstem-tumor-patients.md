### Standard treatment options for DIPG

Children and adolescents with brainstem tumors have no standardized widely accepted treatment. In our hospital service, in the last 15 years, we treated 87 pediatric patients with brainstem tumors. Of those, 24 patients (28%) had focal tumors of the brainstem, which are usually benign, indolent and permit long-term survival if treated properly. In our department, 79% of these patients survived four years or more after their diagnosis, and most remain in follow-up clinic. In contrast, 63 patients (72%) were diagnosed with diffuse pontine tumors (DIPG). Among those patients, survival 2 years after diagnosis was only 6%, and no patients survived more than 4 years.

The DIPG patients were treated with radiotherapy (54%) receiving a dose of 40-54 [Gray][Gray] (Gy), a derived unit of ionizing radiation dose [International System of Units][si]. Radiation therapy is the only treatment accepted as effective for treating DIPG, even though its effects are transient. In 2013 a case-control study was published by [Janssens][janssens] *et al*, in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics. This study compared 27 patients treated with conventional radiation (50-54 Gy in 25-30 daily fractions) with other 27 patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy (39 to 44.8 Gy in 11-16 fractions). The conclusion was that both fractionation schemes and radiation doses can induce improvement in patients, lasting from 5 to 7.6 months. Invariably, all patients worsened after this period, and most died within 9-10 months after treatment initiation. In our service, the 54 Gy divided into 30 daily fractions (over 6 weeks) scheme is used by default.

In our service, 81.6% of patients received chemotherapy (CT). The use of routine chemotherapy for the treatment of this disease is not widely accepted as effective. Still, most of the DIPG patients are treated with chemotherapy, usually in clinical trials. In 2015, [Jansen][jansen] *et al* published the largest retrospective study of prognostic analysis in patients with DIPG, including 316 patients (60% received chemotherapy). They concluded that treatment with chemotherapy plus radiation therapy, slightly increased the overall survival of patients (about 26% lower risk of death, p <0.004). This is in contrast with all previously published prospective clinical trials evaluating chemotherapy for the treatment of DIPG, none of which showed any effect of drug therapy. In our service, we have used both oral as well as intravenously administrated chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with DIPG.
