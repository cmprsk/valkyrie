<p>Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, <a href="http://f1000research.com/posters/4-1362">DIPG</a>, is a tumor almost exclusively found in children and adolescents. It is largely responsible for most of the deaths related to brain tumors in this age group. Nearly 20% of all brain tumors in patients under 18 years are DIPG. This makes it one of the most common malignant brain tumors in young people. The average age of patients is 7 years, there is no difference between sexes or races. It is rare to a patient to have a history of more than 6 months of symptons before diagnosis. Initial signs are facial paralysis, deviation of the eyes, neck pain (torticollis). In a matter of weeks, the intensity and number of symptoms progress and the patient begins to have difficulty swallowing and speaking, as well as gait impairment and paralysis.</p>

<p>Until recently, little was known about this type of tumor and its <a href="http://dipgregistry.org/patients-families/treatment/">treatment</a> was based on the paradigms used for other pediatric brain tumors, with basically no success. The main feature that gave it its the name is the diffusely infiltration and growing into the tissue of the pons, a portion of the brainstem with a large number of key structures for control of various bodyly functions. This feature prevents surgical approach, which is limited, at best, to a image-guided biopsy, not even necessary in most cases. No type of chemotherapy or drug treatment tested to date has shown the ability to at least prolong survival of patients. At most, intensive chemotherapy regimens cause excess adverse effects on patients. The only widely accepted treatment for this disease is cranial radiotherapy, which consistently has the effect of prolonging the survival of patients in several months. Even so, not all patients come to improve clinically usually just halting the progression of symptoms. Invariably, half of the patients experience worsening of symptons within 6 months after radiotherapy, and die within 1 year after diagnosis. There have been rare documented cases of patients who survived more than five years with this disease. Recently a review showed that even those patients had had disease progression years later. They may have an attenuated, but equally lethal, form of this pathology.</p>

<p>Only after completion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project">Human Genome Project</a>, in April 2003, it could start an international effort to sequence the genes involved in the main types of cancer of the human species, with the formation of several groups in a <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/cancer-genome-project">cancer genome Project</a>, made up of dozens of initiatives that integrate their data in an international <a href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">database</a>. One of the projects of this network is the <a href="https://www.stjude.org/research/pediatric-cancer-genome-project.html">Pediatric Cancer Genome Project</a> led by St. Jude Children’s Hospital and Washington University. Together they have revolucionized the knowledge about malignant tumors of children and adolescents. Various types of pediatric cancer have had their genomes sequenced and associated genetic mutations described. Gradually, a genetic landscape of pediatric tumors has been drawn. This has occurred with the most common types of brain cancer in young people, such as medulloblastoma, low-grade gliomas and ependymomas. The same has been done with the brainstem tumors. In <a href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/browse/tissue#sn=central_nervous_system&amp;ss=brainstem&amp;hn=glioma&amp;sh=all&amp;in=t&amp;src=tissue&amp;all_data=n">COSMIC</a> database, one can see that the majority (58%) of brainstem gliomas studied so far depicted mutations of a gene called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H3F3A">H3F3A</a>. This gene encodes the histone protein H3.3, a molecule present in the nucleus of cells and responsible for enveloping the genetic material in a structure called nucleosome. The most frequent mutation of the gene H3F3A, the K27M (p.Lys27Met) is present in over 70% of all cases of DIPG. Another 10% of cases of DIPG show the same amino acid mutation (K27M) in another histone, H3.1. It is not well known how these mutations affect the expression of genes of cells, but apparently they affect how the histones are <em>acetylated</em>, combined with an <em>Acetyl</em> molecule, which affects the transcription of genes, corresponding to a genetic “on-off” key. In a global manner, H3F3A-K27M mutation causes reduced expression of genes at the same time that increases focal expression of a few genes.</p>

<p>Acetylation of histones is regulated by enzymes, such as any organic reaction, being the most important of these enzymes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase">histone deacetylase</a> (HDAC). In recent years, substances that inhibit HDACs showed activity against a number of human cancers, two of which have been approved for the treatment of a type of skin lymphoma, vorinostat and romidepsin. The valproic acid or valproate, a substance synthesized in the nineteenth century and used since the 60’s as antiepileptic drug, is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase_inhibitor#Cancer_treatment">inhibitor</a> of various types of HDAC. It has been tested in several clinical trials for the treatment of various cancers. Some of these clinical trials are being done on children with cancer. Sometime ago, our research group observed a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;user=ZmzTpYgAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=ZmzTpYgAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC">possible effect</a> of valproic acid in patients with DIPG. To test the possibility that this effect is real and not casual, we designed the VALKYRIE trial.</p>

<p><img src="/neuronc_lab/assets/posts/2016-06-02-Um-pouco-sobre-o-tratamento-do-ensaio/figure2.png" alt="image" />
<em>Figure published by our group showing some patients with DIPG (A, B, C) and the response to treatment of one of these patients (D).</em></p>

<p>VALKYRIE is a small clinical trial, which will include a limited number of patients (16). Our goal is not to prove the effect of valproic acid in patients with DIPG. To do this, it would be necessary to carry out a much larger clinical trial with the participation of several research centers. The goal of VALQUIRIA is exploring if the possibility of effect of valproic acid is strong enough to justify a larger clinical trial, which will require more resources and would have to include a large number of patients. For this test, we will compare with a <em>historical control</em> group of previously treated patients from our hospital and also from a <a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/18/6/1246.abstract">previous</a> Brazilian clinical trial. If the results are favorable, it would mean the first real advance in the treatment of this disease in more than 40 years.</p>
