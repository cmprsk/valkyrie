## Reasons to do research:

It is a futile exercise to list all good reasons to do scientific research, and such a "whitelist" will allways let out some good reasons some creative people can come about to do research. Not a good idea. Let people be smart. However, there is a short list of non-obvious **bad reasons** one should never use to justify doing research, and we can focus on those:

1. **I want to discover things.** Nonetheless this sounds a particularly general feeling of all people that research, it is a feature of all curious people, not only scientists. Want to learn? Good, go and read, travel, talk to people different from you. This will be fun and informative. But this is not enough to set up to do science. Science is not fun most of the times. It is boring, tedious, difficult, prone to error and often frustating. Not what you expected, huh? So, although this is _one thing every scientist have in common_, it fits not as a _one reason to do science_.
